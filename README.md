This installer does the following:

- Downloads the most recent supported version of the Claude Desktop client
- Gives it a custom icon
- Unpacks its resources and enables extension loading
- Downloads the Usage Tracker (and soon Toolbox) extensions and installs them
- Runs the client and keeps it up to date

The installer creates a totally separate installation of Claude Desktop wherever it's placed. This installation can co-exist with the normal client just fine.

Supports: MacOS, Windows.

Installation: Just download it from the releases, and run it.
